  <H2>Turning Gold into Lead</H2>
  In a startling breakthrough, scientist B.O. "Gus" Fizzics has
  invented a <STRONG>practical</STRONG> technique for transmutation!
  For more details, please see <A HREF="give-us-your-gold.html">our
    transmutation thesis</A>.
  <H2>Perpetual Inactivity Machine</H2>
  In a radical approach that turned traditional attempts to develop
  perpetual motion machines on their heads, Prof. Fizzics has
  developed a verified, bona fide perpetual inaction machine. To
  purchase your own for only $99.00 (plus $43.29 shipping and
